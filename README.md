# About me
Having recently decided on a career change I’m ready to follow on from the steps I have already taken to become a Software Tester. I believe the recent internship I have completed at the Testing Academy together with the ISTQB qualification I have obtained position me well on the path to become successful in this exciting field. I’m ready to take on the challenge and believe that my existing skills combined with motivation and drive to learn will be an asset in progressing my career.
